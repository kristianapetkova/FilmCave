Hello there!
This is my first web site and here's a bit of information about it!

FilmCave is an online store for books and movies. It is written in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, a bit of JQuery, PHP and MySQLi.

The idea started out of boredom and I developed it to finish university.

FilmCave is build from the perspective of the user and currently there isn't an admin profile.
The user can create a profile, log in, save products in a list with favourites, add to cart, order, view orders and the products and, of course fill a request to return a product.
There is a search bar that the filters the products by whichever title matches the users' text.

I'm currently working on adding an admin profile and filters when listing the products.

Basically this is it, a normal online store. It ain't much, but it's honest work.
